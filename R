 It starts by generating 30 days of realistic stock price data with random fluctuations around an initial $100 value. The core intelligence comes from a prediction function that calculates future prices by averaging recent historical data—specifically using 3-day and 5-day windows to forecast upcoming values. After making these projections, the system evaluates its own accuracy by comparing predictions against actual outcomes, calculating both average dollar errors and percentage accuracy scores. Finally, it presents results through a text-based visualization and offers interactive functionality where users can input their own stock data to test the prediction model, demonstrating fundamental AI concepts of pattern recognition, data analysis, and algorithmic forecasting in financial contexts.
